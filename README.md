# syn_miner_lumber
This is a lightweight mining/lumberjack script i made for my server. it requires the latest vorp inventory lua update 

This fork of syn_miner_lumber allows for the addition of a broken tool when the durability fails. To add a broken tool, create a new item in the database the same as the tool and add '_broken' to the end of the name. When a tool breaks, this will add a new item that is broken version of the old tool.

Thanks goes to Syn for making the original script this was forked from.
